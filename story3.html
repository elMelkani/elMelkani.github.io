<h2> All they care about </h2>
<p>I walked down the street in the darkness amid occasional street-lamp illuminations. 
Then I saw him, in the shadow with his hands in his pockets, his typical stance, watching out for me, his face hidden. 
I walked out of the darkness swiftly turning towards him - meaning to surprise him and said,
<p>&mdash; "How long have you been waiting?"
<p>&mdash; "Fifteen minutes." He said utterly unimpressed.
<p>Further off into the street, in the heart of the market with everything cheerfully alight, it was no different than it had been on our occasional previous meetings. 
His unbridled excitement and my insouciant quietness met leaving slightly uncomfortable remains. 
He wrapped his arm around me and shook me with enthusiasm and a slight restlessness. My pensiveness seemed to have given him an air of condescension typical of him.
<p>&mdash; "You were not happy with the people there. How are things now?"
<p>&mdash; "Not happy?" I wasn't eager to pursue this topic of conversation.
<p>&mdash; "Yes... you said people there have no appreciation for art." I could detect a slight tone of mockery for me. "So what happened of that problem?"
<p>&mdash; "It's still there."
<p>&mdash; "Oh. You shouldn't care for such things you know. People are mostly assholes..." 
<p>He suddenly turned to me with laughter in his face.
<p>&mdash; "I mean all people are assholes but some are too much to give a damn about."
<p>Not knowing or caring whether he meant to speak of me or himself I said nothing and his laughter subsided.
<p>&mdash; "It's completely pointless to have any kind of expectation from people", he said seriously.
<p>The town is all lit up and as we walk by the lake, which is sparkling and quivering in the breeze and the lights, I think I should talk to him and oh but how do I?
How do I tell him that I was late because I just could not put down a book I had been reading, that I had to bury my face in it to stifle my sobs, 
because I had been reminded of things I never thought would touch me again, because I had been overcome and overpowered, taken and destroyed. That I had to sit and wait 
in a stony silence waiting for the strength to move to come back to me. And to walk in darkness knowing that I would not be released, not so soon, that I, being drenched in those words, 
could not talk or even think of other things. I looked into the water for some moments then I clenched my wretched heart, cleared my throat and spoke to him.
And I told him about the book - when it was published, the extent of its influence on culture and how it is said to have formed its own genre. I told him how I had happened
to see it lying in a corner of the book-store and I recommended most vehemently that he buy it too.
<p>He listened carefully, making a few comments, following everything I said. 
<p>When I had run out of myself we walked silently again. My impassiveness must have made him restless again so wrapping his arm around my shoulder once more he shook me and went:
<p>&mdash; "So... how are you Abhijeet?"
<p>And realizing that he had understood nothing, that nothing reached him or he cared for nothing, I turned to face him and with uplifted eyebrows said as solemnly as ever.
<p>&mdash; "Good" - which finally took his slick self aback and shut him up completely.
<p>Some distance later though he ventured to ask me,
<p>&mdash; "Can I ask you a question Abhijeet? Something totally unrelated to ourselves or anything."
<p>&mdash; "Of course."
<p>&mdash; "Do you...believe...in the right to choice? I mean do you mean that every man has that inalienable right to life and pursuit of happiness? Do you believe in that?"
<p>&mdash; "Well, yes", I said carefully.
<p>&mdash; "Because I do not see any other alternative leading to a stable system", I added so as to soften my stance.  I was definitely not in a mood for argument.
<p>&mdash; "Yes, yes, that is true but there must be something else, don't you think? I mean most people need someone to tell them what to do and left to themselves they will only bring chaos. 
There must be some way, some election, no not an election, but some test of some kind to decide the leaders of the people. Those who are smart enough to lead the herd."
<p>And then encouraged by my lack of disagreement, 
<p>&mdash; "Because you see people have become idiots, assholes, everywhere, just look around you. Nobody cares for facts anymore! All they care about is feelings! 
They cling on to their petty little sentiments, their palatable versions of reality, and they burst out in petulant indignations when someone calls them out on their pretenses. 
Something needs to be done about it!"
<p>People are assholes I said to myself but I did not feel it. Not then. Because suddenly I thought, looking at his passion, 
that perhaps everyone has been hurt in some way or the other. 
That perhaps I must have hurt him too tonight, insignificantly perhaps but still, with my utter indifference to his typical manner of friendship. 
And that the thought of my rights being taken away was the most horrible thought to me ever. I have always been running away from everything and freedom is all that I cherish. 
And I knew that he would never think of that because he always imagined himself to be one of those smart people of his imagined utopia. 
So I said nothing, nothing at all, and kept walking and I knew that he was certainly hurt now. He told me so later.
