<h2> Everyone laughed </h2>

<p>On the day of the great humiliation, it was Mr. H. who was the first to set out of his house. He walks slowly and self-consciously with a pride which is only petulant indignation. 
And he walks under the bright yellow sun on the warm dusty street. It smells of morning and it makes him think of little thoughts half-cheerful half-pensive.

<p>It was to be a day of great jubilation but Mr. S. and Mr. T. stepped out of their rooms well late into the morning with sore bloodshot eyes. 
A cat scrambles out of Mr. T.'s room - he must have been caressing her through the night. He lay on his bed the rest of the morning then with his face all covered up, all folded up. 
Mr. S. grew cheerful as the sleepiness wore off him, as he combed his hair carefully, and brushed his teeth with minty paste. He stamps his foot near the cat and laughs as she runs meowing indignantly.

<p>Mr. K. was already awake a long time ago though - we do not know when. He came out of his room when he heard the other two walking about.

<p>&mdash; The crows were so loud this morning. Did someone die?, he asks. And he is ignored.

<p>&mdash; It was staring at the wall yesterday. Confesses Mr. T. to Mr. S. who has a hearty laugh at the absurdity of it. 
It makes his toothpaste drip all over his chest and perhaps it is what makes him laugh harder.

<p>Two other characters enter this story of that fateful day. Mr. W. is seated in Mr. V.'s bedroom. The latter is sprawled on his bed and cursing the tragic figure of our story. 
Mr. W. nods, makes dumb jokes, laughs. He likes to be included in great events and the event to be is a great one in his opinion. The blinds are down in their room. 
The cheerful sun and the happy birds calling to their mates are locked away.

<p>Let us not get confused with the myriad characters introduced. We have completed the list. Except, of course, for the tragic figure but that one is too nondescript to waste our time on.

<p>Now, Mr. H. had already reached near the place of the ambush and his pace had slowed down considerably. 
If you were to pay careful attention you might witness a speck of a grimace, a pout in his lips and eyes of injury. 
He thinks that the others would have perhaps changed the plans a little and forgot to inform him. His resentfulness though is tired and calm. 
He is enjoying himself looking at the girls entering the college gate and we are happy for him.

<p>Mr. S. and Mr. K. and Mr. T. have set out too. Mr. K. is making up for his friends' perception of his lack of courage by some quick-witted jokes. 
Mr. T. cracks into laughter, the kind that slowly builds up into loud raucousness. Mr. S. sniggers and slaps his forehead and slaps his knee and sniggers long past the joke is dead. 
We suspect it is only Mr. S. who is not nervous but that may just be personal bias.

<p>Mr. W. and Mr. V. are preparing the tools for the great humiliation and stuffing them into a bag. 
Having spent up all his bitterness, Mr. V. is deadpan while Mr. W. is wheedling around somewhat nervous somewhat genuinely excited. 
Mr. V. is getting bored of allow me to call Mr. W.'s jackal like temperament. They finally set out.

<p>Misters H, K, S, and T are waiting for Misters V and W at the place of the ambush - the place as we mentioned is to be the place of the great humiliation. 
Misters V and W have arrived and to cut the story short our tragic figure has already been ambushed upon, bound, kicked about, and cursed.

<p>The Misters then paused for a moment wondering what should be done next. K probably was glad that it will now end and W probably was restless and unsatisfied. But who knows the hearts of such men? 

<p>Mr. V. stepped up to the sprawling figure.

<p>&mdash; Eat it, motherfucker! as he thrust it right into the mouth.

<p>There was a gurgling sound as of a kid blowing air into a soft-drink bottle or the groan of a hungry stomach as a wise someone remarked.

<p>&mdash; The hunger was underestimated. Laughter followed easily compared to other somber situations. Oh of course everyone was gay and drunk and in a spirit of fool-hardiness. 
Each bottle was to be emptied and shattered on the tragic head of the tragic figure. It was a dance, a menagerie as they attempted to beat each other in a game of the loudest shatters. 
The crows and the pigeons added to the racket. And dogs watched from a distance. It was a great show!

<p>And as V and W and H and K and S and T pulled out the various paraphernalia from the well-prepared bag and performed a number of tricks on the unfortunate figure, there was laughter, much laughter, evasive, defensive, and derisive laughter. 
It made us think there is in the hearts of men much bitterness and belittlement. But then we say look again!

<p>Look at them so cheerful, laid back, at ease and jolly. Their laughter loud, perhaps not happy but full of youth and vitality! 
It is contemptuous laughter and more it is a laughter with a desire to be contemptuous! 
And that my dear readers is what turns the tables over empires and builds new ones over them, rolls the stone over the bridge and paves the way to new lands. 
And so they laughed and we rejoiced and so did the dogs and the pigeons and the crows and other creatures of our Lord.

<p>And even though Mr. S. stared for a second into the depths. There were no depths he laughed. Slowly crookedly he laughed with little feeling. 
And Mr. K's eyes were a little blank, a little timid and defensive. And Mr. H's mouth opened, his jaws a little misaligned as if to protest sarcastically. 
And Mr. V is stuck to the cross of his lust and his fear of emasculation though he moves faster, faster even than a horse. 
And even though Mr. T's laughter has almost gobbled itself up, his eyes like wide beetles and Mr. W had been shouting - fuck it! -  for the past few minutes the laughter never subsided.

<p>Bright red like the strawberries of Easter was the blood that was spread about our tragic figure and while Mr. K. puked a green, a green of algae that grows near lotuses, cascade and laughters were turning into coughs and Mr. V and Mr. W. were bathed with fury and sweat that suddenly Mr. T. pulled away.

<p>&mdash; I did nothing! You vile vile creatures! I have nothing to do with all this sick shit! I have had it. He stuttered when he spoke but that was what he said more or less. 
His beetle eyes were wide open in a daze of utter fear. The laughter was subsiding and so Mr. S. and Mr. K. tried desperately to calm him down.

<p>&mdash; Nothing that you did. Nothing that you did was wrong, okay. Mr. K. was saying while Mr. S. held him tight and pressed onto his shoulders.

<p>&mdash; Come here. said Mr. V handing him the tool. Have fun. And he left and went towards the bag, bent down to look for something - a hatchet!

<p>Mr. T. paused for a moment feeling the shape of the wet piece of metal tool. 
Then the general menagerie of shoutings and hysterical laughter engulfed his awareness, the bright specks of the morning hovered and he was blinded for a moment in which he let go of the reins and what was left of him shouted along, clattering a rain of pebbles, shouting, kicking on the mud, grinning and grinning still, swinging its arm again and again, before it was chased by Mr. V. and his hatchet and it ran down the alley but was caught and fell and held and had its head chopped off with multiple frantic violent swings to great applause. 

<p>The procession went on then with rejuvenated enthusiasm although the crows had flown away cawing ominously and every mouth laughed and every mouth laughed until it ached and all lips were caked with sullen glory while the dead eyes of Mr. T's head, still open and dull with alarm and fear, watched his dear friends laughing.
