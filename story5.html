<h2> Bernard </h2>

<p>Perhaps we will see you again, The Old Teacher said at the foot of the bridge, when I finally set out to leave for the lands beyond. 
Only the two of you can perhaps one day surprise me he had confessed once speaking of Bernard and I. 

<p>But I had known better. It was a late evening in the marble corridors that looked out to the river many years ago. 
It was then that I had seen for the first time, in the ripples of The Teacher's throat, the stirring points in his eyes, an emotion I had never felt could reach him. 
Bernard had stood up slowly. He faced us casually and it seemed he was looking not at us but at something beyond. 
I did not shudder but I felt an insatiable thirst for violence reeking out of him. Yes, it was then when I looked at The Teacher and it was then that I first knew of my own fears.

<p>A hundred years later I find myself walking back towards the hills, encumbered and scarred. The paths have overgrown with bushes. Not many have ventured I think to myself. 
I slash at the bushes again with my long knife. There is a rock beyond this turn I remember. Perhaps I will rest there for a moment. I duck under a thorny branch and emerge out of the turn.

<p>Perched on the top of the rock looking away towards the river is Bernard. Unchanged, unaged, as if it was only I who had to carry the burden of years. He turns towards me casually. 
Shocked, I say the only thing that comes to my mind:

<p>&mdash; How have you been?

<p>&mdash; I never really did finish training, he answered smiling ruefully.

<p>&mdash; Oh, I said feeling a bitter tired pride. The Old Teacher never let him go. He never did qualify. He is trapped in places we had long left behind. 
As I realize the implications I am impressed by his open acceptance of his fate.

<p>We walk towards home now, Bernard and I, and all the while we have a hesitant conversation. I am thinking hard not to say anything that could stir the bitterness of our past.

<p>The area is more arid now. No bushes, only shrubs and sand and stone. We climb up the mountains and down the valleys following the trails. 
He is quite silent, quite different from what he used to be, and I wonder whether his misfortunes have softened him. 
Whenever he speaks, of some trifle or the other, it seems he measures his words very carefully. 

<p>His pale skin gleams in the evening's light - I look at my own scarred arms. It seems strange to me to think of him as sorrowful. 
He makes a shy little joke now and I laugh cheerfully. 

<p>We meet Erodom from whom I borrow money for a drink. I am surprised by his generosity but then he seems too distracted and preoccupied to notice. 
Bernard and Erodom, they do not meet eyes.

<p>We are approaching the last hill - the toughest climb of all. Bernard bravely takes the first few steps but then cannot go further. 
I look around and discover a different easier path. I climb up and help him across too. We are on the summit now and I know it is home that lies before us down in the valley. 

<p>&mdash; Is it true, then? 

<p>I turn around to see The Old Teacher standing some distance away looking at us. Somehow, I am certain he asks about this new friendship between Bernard and I. 
A warmth fills up in me when I too realize how different things are now. 

<p>&mdash; Yes, it is. I say. And just as I say it, a terrible dizziness takes hold of me and I fall to the ground. 
It is as if a strong gale is blowing and I have to hold on to the ground lest it blow me away to death. 
From the corner of my eye I see Bernard and The Teacher standing unperturbed looking at me. 

<p>&mdash; You will save me, won't you?! Help me down?! 

<p>Against the light of the sun and the sparkling lake below I see their silhouettes standing there completely still looking down at me. And they do not answer.
