<h2> As I am </h2>
<h3>1.</h3>

<p>Because... because my heart was in full bloom! And it knew that it wanted something! No, no, that's not original. It's a song. Haven't you heard it?...
<p>Well it was far from my place so I had to take the train. Three stations away. Yes not very far...
<p>Only a little nervous. And there weren't many people on the train. There were these two little children reading a picture-book together. 
You should have seen them! And when the little boy fell asleep on his sister's lap she propped the picture book on his back you know. 
My God, how seriously she was reading it! I wondered what she was thinking. They looked so cute and comfortable! 
And I caught their mother's eyes and we smiled. It was such a peaceful moment...
<p>And you know there's a tunnel in that route. And it always scared me a little, remember? 
And this was my first time riding alone and I suddenly thought, my God, it will swallow us all. Crazy I know. But when it came. 
<p>Whooooooosh. 
<p>You know I kind of enjoyed it this time! I don't know. Maybe it was the children sitting peacefully or a sense of adventure. I don't really know. 
I remember noticing how the train shakes differently you know. A more violent panicky murmur in the tunnel. Have you noticed it? But even then I didn't think much of it... 
<p>And then something funny happened!
<p>I looked at the window and I saw a face! A face! For a second I was scared and almost started from my seat. But then I laughed. Yes it was me! Imagine! 
I couldn't recognize myself I looked so pretty and different! Zana is so good at what she does. So I stared into my own eyes. Rearranged my hair a little. 
All the time thinking I'll walk in like this. Wouldn't it be a treat to see the look on their faces! Sasha! Sasha aghast! Just like that day! And Zach and Misha too. 
And everyone. And they would see me, yes. And I'll just say this is who I am. That's what I'd say....
<p>Well that was only a moment and the train broke into the light again and the sky was blue so blue as if clouds never existed! I stretched my legs and all. 
So smooth and beautiful they looked. Then I thought I better sit like this. You know the way that American woman holds that cigarette in that ad right near the bus-stop? 
Yes exactly. And although my heels were black I think I would have looked just like her. You should have seen me. If only someone was to walk in and see me so elegant I thought! 
But there was only that woman and her kids...
<p>Then we reached the stop and I waved goodbye. And as I walked out I felt oh the city rises up to admire me now. I felt the world welcome me with open arms. 
I was walking to the end of the corridor stepping tall and confident, turning faces. My young heart beating in awe as I stand at the threshold.
I looked up. I'd never felt so called. I said:
<p>I can see myself!
<p>I can feel!

<h3>2.</h3>

<p>And Andrei only said let's go and Zach only raised his eyebrows and smiled in collusion. But I knew they were silently taking the time to take it all in. 
And it tickled me immensely though I did not laugh and put on perfect nonchalance as if nothing had changed. But of course Sasha, you know her, wouldn't have any of it. 
So she had to mention that she'd heard Lev is coming too. And you should have seen her, lips pursed, eyes glinting and all but I did not care. That bitch....
<p>And I shrugged because I didn't care. And even though Zach came up to me quietly saying you know you shouldn't think of her. She's just jealous of you. He was always sweet. 
I just smiled at him. I know I don't mind. Yes he was always sweet but that's because he fancies me. Silly fool...
<p>They're just narrow or mean or small. And I want better things now. For some reason it reminded me of the Christmas before last, you remember, I told you. 
The way they all looked at me with their piteous faces saying poor silly Chechina. Well look at me now!... 
<p>No I don't always put up with them... 
I blasted them off the next day you know that. It's just after those moments I feel a lonely pit in my stomach. And who would want sadness in this world anyway?... 
<p>So I just buried them in my mind and stepped over them, walking ahead, taking this giant step forward you know in my mind.
And I thought there's a great wind blowing from the north. Bringing clouds. I just felt that great wind would just scatter them away.

<h3>3.</h3>

<p>Most of them were at the table at the end. I could see it so clearly that they were watching me and asking about me. 
Who am I they were saying! It amused me so much! I just laughed into my glass and turned my head half away... 
<p>Because I knew He was there. I wouldn't stare across for Him again but our eyes had met. 
And suddenly aware of myself I could make out my long eyelashes spreading from the edges of my eyes ever so coyly and I knew my eyes sparkled and I laid my bare arm across the arm of the chair. 
I felt His eyes search me and wound me and my heart heaved...
<p>So I distanced myself further, I knew what I wanted, and walked towards the window and I knew He would come for me now. I was sure of it. 
My head was spinning a little and my heart was fazed. But I knew He would come and my soul thrilled at the thought... 
<p>I raised my drink to my lips and tapped my foot lightly to the music. I knew I was doing everything right and I could not think of anything else now. He was watching.
I stood alone. Outside there was a storm now, inside me too, you know. It is so so strange how inconstant I am. How utterly overwhelmed by everything. 
Outside on the tree I think there's a leaf trembling, trembling violently and you will never know when it will break. Only when it does. 
Oh if only He could come to me and reach out and hold my hand and tell me it will all be alright I can walk through any storms anywhere. I just needed it. 
Nothing else made any sense. I felt emptied of everything else with nowhere else to go. I took another swig...
<p>I've had too many. I've had too much. I look to Him. See me.

<h3>4.</h3>

<p>Hey! Aren't you beautiful?
<p>And you wouldn't know what hit you. Only that you're floating now. For some reason. So I just said Am I? Which was obviously not the cleverest thing to say.
<p>And He smiled and nodded ever so slowly with a twinkle in his deep dark eyes I thought I would not I should not lean into Him fall into Him or do or say anything 
and just hold myself out to Him and let Him take me. Just keep myself steady and elegant and poised.
<p>We should get to know each other.
<p>Yes, I breathed yes. But a slight frown surfaced ever so gently on His smooth brow and was there scorn in his smile? Did He think I was dumb? I wanted to say, no, I'm not. I'm not! So I did. 
And I did everything I was supposed to do and it flowed out of me by some miracle and I became what I wanted to be in front of Him and I did everything correctly. And He was charmed absolutely and totally charmed and amazed! I could see it!
<p>And I felt for those moments I wasn't even there. I knew that Sasha and everyone were looking at us. And when He waved, see you next time, I felt I had done it I should leave everything now. I held something to my breast I don't even know. 
I was floating. And I was happy. Filled up.

<h3>5.</h3>

<p>And that was how I got everything I wanted. What else do you want to know?

<h3>*.</h3>

<p>The storm has died.
<p>Across from the bridge and along the river and the street that run all the way to the bus-stop where an American woman regards you with disdain there are trees and atop the trees 
the mad cries of birds and beneath the shimmering leaves she walks by. 
Crickets hidden in shadows cry out to you, the wind moves things in her gay flight, shadows of blades of grass tremble and the cries echo and waver. 
Oh loss and eternal solitude! Everything here tells you to go away to your own abode. 
She looks down at her bleeding hands waiting, not waiting, for something inside her to tick, to give away, and break. Why? When I got everything I wanted?
<p>Up the stairs now of a worn out apartment, dusk casts long shadows and as they fade she thinks am I fading? Who am I? 
The day has ended and the play of children is over, they're shouting out their goodbyes and their mothers take them in and care for them. A man sleeps in his hammock. 
From the windows of a neighbouring flat she catches the words of a song. 
<p align="center">...
<p align="center">I know the evening's empire has returned into sand
<p align="center">Vanished from my hand, Left me blindly here to stand
<p align="center">...
<p>The sky is red and crimson and into the window of the third floor room it spreads its fingers and lies quietly in the dust. 
A faint red glow is on the wall, patches where the plaster fell off. A crow keeps crying as it flies away, fading away. 
A towel draped on a hanger twitches under the ceiling fan. Am I fading? The window glass can admit no more than a glow. A faint glow and darkness everywhere else. What am I?
<p>She sighs to let go of strands of thoughts. An unfinished sculpture is dumped into the bin.
She undresses quietly and calmly washes away all the layers and facades, fragility and allure and the painted muddied water rushes into the sink-hole. She faces herself naked in the mirror,
 in the red light of a day that is over, and finally recognizes herself. Rediscovers herself. Perhaps even redeems herself. As I am! As I am! She almost cried.
