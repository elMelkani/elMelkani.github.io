<h2> What is it like  </h2>

<p>When I was about fourteen we moved to a new place at the outskirts of a stupid town. There wasn't much to do and for whatever reason I was in a quiet and moody kid phase at that time. 
I didn't try to make any friends at the new school and anyway the other guys didn't trouble me either because I was bigger than them. I had always been much bigger than my age. 
So I sat in my corner and mostly daydreamt through the day. My parents were worried about me but then they were worried about so many other things too. 
I don't know whether I liked the attention of being asked how my day went or completely hated it.

<p>There weren't many kids around my place either and books used to bore me. 
So I started taking walks in the evening kicking a can around or something and eventually discovered a little park kind of place far from my house. 
It wasn't a park actually - just a huge lawn of a broken-down mansion. It had a bench in the corner, a path that led around a tattered green-house, and lots of overgrown plants and trees and stuff. 
I examined this park for a few days and then eventually it became a habit for me to come there every evening and play to myself.

<p>I would look for slugs and poke them or throw ants at them. I would pick up a stick and pretend I was a robber hacking away at the branches of the trees who guarded the green-house. 
Ducking behind a stone stealing up to a tree and with a quick leap slashing away at its trunk crying - haa! 
And the tree would be dead and I would have to quickly hide again before his friends came to see what is up. 
Or I would be a treasure-seeker examining the ruins of the mansion poking around with a cane again. I had soon assembled an arsenal of favourite "swords". I think I even named them. 
And each had its special properties. It surprises me now how I could amuse myself in my play-world when at the same time nothing much in the world ever caught my fancy or excited me.

<p>Now on some days I would find a woman sitting on the bench in that park. She looked Japanese so I did stare a bit too much at her at first. She told me she was half-Japanese but that was much later. 
So I would find her sitting on the bench with a neat long skirt and dark sweater or something. She wore the kind of shoes that I wore to school - I remember that. But it didn't look very funny on her. 
She would sit there calmly with a hint of a kind smile on her face or reading very attentively, with her finger following the words, from a tiny tiny book.

<p>Now on the first day when I saw her I think I just left the park for I didn't want some old lady prying into my business. 
But eventually I would go in and play, my cries now a stifled whisper, behind the green-house where she couldn't see me. Or just take a peaceful walk looking for slugs. 
I hated her with the angsty hate I had for everyone those days but then I didn't really hate her for she seemed quaint and gentle. 
She never talked to me but she would look at me and smile and although I avoided meeting eyes with her I might sometimes awkwardly smile back at her.

<p>It wasn't long before I started playing my usual games outright in front of her, if she happened to be there. And for her to look up from her book and follow my game utterly amused in her quiet way. 
She talked to me once or twice. Always asking a little question which it seemed she had been rolling over in her mind to form it properly in English. 
She never asked my name I think -but she did ask where I lived, what my parents did, how many siblings I had, where I went to study, and all that. 
She would have only one or two questions in a day and an odd enthusiastic way of beckoning me towards her when she wanted to ask it from me.

<p>Truth be told I liked her. For one thing she wouldn't talk too much. And then I liked the attention - she remembered everything I told her. 
And she would always nod smiling knowingly to my answers, which were a bit curt I must admit. Her English wasn't that bad. 
She just faltered a lot with it and opened her eyes wide with attention when I spoke to her, asking me to repeat if she didn't get it the first time. On my part, I never asked her anything much. 
I always felt that under her smiling neat appearance, she was lonely and had suffered a sad fate. I was certain she had no children or they had gone away or something and she missed them terribly. 
And I felt if I were to ask her of anything like that it would get awkward and I wouldn't know how to deal with it.

<p>One day we left the park together and she asked me if I would like to accompany her to a monastery that was in the route to my house. 
I had seen the monastery, of course, but only from outside and it seemed nothing impressive but I obliged. It was late evening and the sky was becoming golden. 
The gloomy houses on our way seemed to have gone to sleep. Oddly I felt a strange sense of friendship with her and felt I should say something. I did not though. 
I just asked her if she came there often and she nodded vigorously but said sometimes.

<p>We entered the gates. She demonstrated how to take off my shoes and everything. Inside the gates it was peaceful.
 There were well-tended plants and a little pond beside which was a rock on which a fat cat was sleeping. We did not go in but sat on a bench. 
 The building looked kind of impressive and mysterious with its odd roof, I later learnt it's called a pagoda, and the strange demons etched on the pillars. I took a little walk all around it. 
 There were crows cawing somewhere far away. And the little blue and white and red flowers glimmered as the wind shook them. I sat next to her again for a long time as she stared towards the monastery. 
 She asked me if I was bored and I answered still staring up at the pagoda where the last gleam of sunshine was slowly taking leave that no, not at all, and she smiled happily.

<p>A week or so later she told me excitedly that her niece had come to visit for a few days and she would like us to meet. So we decided to walk from the park to a nearby cafe the next day. 
And I didn't think anymore of it.

<p>Next day I arrive at the park as usual and find her sitting there, waiting, and we set out to the cafe. 

<p>And there she sat at the table in the very corner. Dressed in something red with flowery patterns. 
She stood up, her almond eyes looked directly at mine, stayed for some time, before she smiled and bowed. And yes I did nothing at all but nodded and smiled a bit. 
Her aunt talked rapidly in Japanese to her, her hand kept flourished towards me making me feel as if I was in spotlight. The girl nodded rapidly. Then she said hello to me and I said hi. 
She did not know English well enough it turned out. She could understand a bit but couldn't speak at all she said (while her aunt translated) and all the time she laughed and shook her head.

<p>All of us ordered some iced tea or something. 
And then the aunt would tell her something about me in rapid Japanese to which the girl exclaim -really? or -uh huh? or something equivalent I suppose while sipping from her straw. 
Then she would ask a question and the aunt would translate and it would turn out to be something like what my favourite subject in school is or does my little brother trouble me much and so on. 
But I was happy in a strange way, sipping the bitter tea, to see the two women talking so happily and excitedly about me I suppose. 
And I answered when I had to answer looking for the simplest words for the benefit of the aunt while the girl looked straight at me with rapt attention trying to decipher the words herself.

<p>Her hair was jet black and tightly combed into a strange bun. 
And her hands bare from the elbows onwards would sometimes grasp each other happily, touch her ear, make a gesture, and dance all around and I was mesmerized. Her fingers were small and neat and pale. 
The evening was getting late and I was falling into a reverie, my eyes following without restraint the hollow at her loose sleeves, her neck, the curve at her bosom. I was lost, in a haze, in a dream. 
The bottle of honey sparkled gold and I was at the barley fields again where I grew up. I was showing her around and we didn't have to speak because we smiled and we understood each other perfectly. 
My spirits were growing wilder and I knew, certain as ever, so were hers, and she was going to run to the stream below and I would chase her laughing and we would fall, fall deep into a soft embrace...

<p>Fourteen I said. My ears went red and I pressed my knees together. She had asked me my age and I burst out of my reverie into a severe dreadful guilt. 
Had she noticed my staring? Did she guess what I had been thinking? I did look bigger than fourteen. Did she think me a monster? What had taken over me anyway? 

<p>I sat there cursing myself and looked away. The peace in me was gone. I felt sinful and unclean. I was angry - at myself, at the world again and the air was stirring wildly in my head. 
I felt restless and wanted to run away. Why don't I ask her anything?

<p>&mdash; And what is your age?

<p>She stared for a moment repeating the words to herself before she understood.

<p>&mdash; Twenty, she said and appeared slightly abashed.

<p>But the feeling did not go away. In my heart I felt as if I had been guilty of some horrible crime. I felt strangely the presence of a gap widening between us frustrating me further. 
I asked her if she went to college. Her aunt translated.

<p>And the girl showed me a picture on her phone of a city with some ordinary squarish building among the trees where her college was. Her nails were smooth but I don't think she put anything on it. 
Not that I knew anything about it. But I remember noting that.

<p>Presently she was saying something excitedly in Japanese. Translated to how her friends used to sneak from college into a cafe. 
But when she finished she seemed visibly distracted by my moody sadness and the conversation tapered off. The aunt said finally that it was getting time.

<p>We stood up. The girl handed me a paper packet, "gift-uh ... Japanese snack-uh", which I accepted with grace expressing my regretful that I didn't think of bringing anything for her. 
And she smiled and carefully pronounced "kind".

<p>The three of us walked together then out into the lamp-lit streets. It was late enough for my parents to be very worried. 
I would be asked where I had been and I knew I would lie or just refuse to explain my lateness but I was feeling too sad to be rebellious.

<p>Sadness wafted over me making me silent and I walked a little behind the two of them. I knew that I would never ever see her again. I kept telling myself that to make myself sadder. 
I wanted to make myself cry but I knew that that would be ridiculous. I looked to the sky feeling like this moment deserves something. I should be doing something. 

<p>I remembered a painting I had seen in an encyclopedia at home. 
Titled something like "What are we? Where are we going?..." with pale blue figures tending to babies, worshipping idols, dying, wandering. It always scared me a little. So did its title. 
In that moment too I was filled me with a strange foreboding for the whole wide world out there and me so small. But then I also felt a wild hunger for life. 
I did not know what exactly I felt but it was something huge subduing me to be only a witness in silence.

<p>She was walking ahead now with her petticoats billowing and her short flowery jacket. They were talking about the wind. How the wind blows. And how time flies. 
My eyes turned to her ankles and her feet in her sandals and the sway of her slight figure. I was too sad to be a monster. I felt pure in my sadness.

<p>I imagined then that back where she belongs she could speak to people and they would understand her and speak back to her. And they would talk and laugh with her. 
And she will have friends, lots of them, and fun and she will have a lover and will get married and she'll have kids and she'll talk to the kids and smile at them. 
And all the time I imagined her just as I saw her now in her pretty youth never aging. 
And she will grow old (looking just like this) and one day she will die and her children and her friends and her family and her lover will all go to heaven and I saw before my eyes her petticoats billowing and her circling and rising upwards happy and smiling while golden dust and threads engulfed her. 
Pink petals of the Japanese kind. And there was the laughter of little children and happy voices of a language I couldn't understand. And they all rose up and up into heaven. 
Where her aunt would already be waiting peacefully. And I would never be part of them. I would be unseen, forgotten. I would never know what it is like.

<p>I said goodbye. I even bowed as I knew the Japanese do and I could see it amused her much and she bowed even lower. 
And I walked to the turn from where our ways diverged and I looked back and waved but did not meet eyes with them. They were waving enthusiastically and friendlily. 
When i took the turn i knew that was the last I will ever see her face. I kept telling myself that holding onto the snack that I swore I will never eat.

<p>I walked up to my home filling up with anguish, trying to make myself cry but couldn't, and went straight upstairs to my room. I lay on my bed a long time not really thinking about anything. 
I felt weak and battered and was grateful later that no-one disturbed me.

<p>We stayed at that place for a few weeks more I think and then shifted again. I had stopped going to the park and usually just took walks lost in my own thoughts. School got no better. 
I had taken a fancy to her name. It sounded strange to my voice. I murmured it sometimes just for the sake for it. So strange and foreign and mysterious it sounded. 
I was not foolish enough to fancy that I had fallen in love or anything. 
But I did imagine how it would have been had I told her then, for of course it was true that evening, that I loved her forever and ever for all the little things and how absurd it would be. 
And I felt bitter about the fact that it would be absurd. Why should it be absurd? I felt bitter against all things. That's all I suppose.

<p>I avoided looking at the park if I passed by there but once I saw the Japanese woman sitting there again. I went up to her, and ignoring her excited questions, asked her about the niece. 
She said she had left. That was all she said. I felt bitter later but never went to the park again.

<p>At our new home I once searched for the rice snack she had given me but couldn't find it event though I had carefully hidden it in a nice place. 
After an hour or so of frantic searching all over my room I finally straightened my back and sat down at my bed. Probably my little brother had eaten it. I felt no anger then though. 
It was the closing of the doors of fate, the last drop that tips the scales and sets a clockwork in motion. 
Life is going to be hard I felt quietly, if it is possible to feel quietly, as I started to put things back again.
